# Cloud Platform quickstart

The Cloud Platform quickstart can be used to create an application for starting the cloud platform with related components like HTTP RESTful protocol adapter and JSON payload encoding. The main purpose is to show how to start implementing a custom service and calling it with different protocols using related adapters.
More information about the Cloud Platform is [here](https://rhiot.gitbooks.io/rhiotdocumentation/content/cloudplatform/cloudplatform.html).
